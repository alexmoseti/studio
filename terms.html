                <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Welcome to Astha Studio. By accessing or using our services, you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions. Please read them carefully as they govern your relationship with Astha Studio, your use of our website, and any services we provide.
                </p>
        
                <h3>1. General Terms</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Astha Studio is a professional photography and videography studio. The services we provide are subject to the terms outlined here. By booking a session or engaging with our services, you agree to abide by these terms. We reserve the right to update or modify these terms at any time without prior notice. It is your responsibility to review this page regularly.
                </p>
        
                <h3>2. Booking and Payments</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    To secure a booking with Astha Studio, a non-refundable deposit is required at the time of booking. Full payment must be made before or on the day of the scheduled shoot. The deposit is necessary to reserve the time and date, and without it, your session is not confirmed.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Deposits are non-refundable but can be transferred to another session within six months in case of rescheduling.</li>
                    <li>Full payments should be made through the approved methods listed on our website (credit card, bank transfer, etc.).</li>
                    <li>If you need to reschedule, we require at least 48 hours' notice; otherwise, your deposit may be forfeited.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h3>3. Cancellation Policy</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    If you wish to cancel your session, please notify us as soon as possible. Cancellations made less than 48 hours prior to the scheduled shoot will result in the loss of your deposit. In exceptional circumstances (such as illness or emergency), we may reschedule your session without penalty.
                </p>
        
                <h3>4. Copyright and Ownership</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Astha Studio retains full copyright to all images and videos captured during a session unless otherwise agreed upon in writing. You are purchasing a license to use the images or videos for personal or commercial purposes, depending on the type of session booked. Unauthorized reproduction, sale, or distribution of the images is strictly prohibited.

                <ul>
                    <li>Clients may use the images for personal, non-commercial purposes unless a commercial license is explicitly agreed upon.</li>
                    <li>For commercial usage, specific licensing agreements must be in place.</li>
                    <li>Astha Studio reserves the right to use images for promotional materials, portfolio, or marketing unless the client requests otherwise in writing.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h3>5. Client Responsibilities</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    As a client, you are responsible for ensuring timely arrival at the scheduled session. If there are specific requirements or requests for your shoot, you should communicate them clearly before the session to avoid any misunderstandings. You are also responsible for ensuring that any third parties (e.g., models, makeup artists) involved in the shoot adhere to the agreed schedule.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Astha Studio is not responsible for delays caused by the client or third parties.</li>
                    <li>Additional fees may apply if extra time is required due to client delays.</li>

                <p class="paragraph">
                    When booking our studio for a session, you agree to abide by our studio policies, which include taking care of the equipment, respecting the space, and leaving the studio in the same condition it was found. Any damage to the studio or its equipment caused by the client or any third party will be the clientâ€™s responsibility.
                </p>
        
                <h3>8. Privacy and Confidentiality</h3>

                <h3>9. Liability</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Astha Studio is not liable for any injuries, accidents, or damages that occur during a photo or video session. Clients and participants are responsible for their own safety and actions during the shoot. Additionally, we are not responsible for any unforeseen circumstances that may delay the session, such as weather or technical failures.
                </p>
        
                <h3>10. Force Majeure</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    Astha Studio is not responsible for any failure to perform its services due to circumstances beyond our control, including but not limited to natural disasters, pandemics, power outages, or other acts of God. In such cases, we will make every effort to reschedule your session or provide an alternative solution.
                </p>
